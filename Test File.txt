Andromeda The History of The Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon

VOLUME ONE

Introduction

Preface By The Editor

The great work of Gibbon is indispensable to the student of history The
literature of Europe offers no substitute for The Decline and Fall of
the Roman Empire It has obtained undisputed possession as rightful
occupant of the vast period which it comprehends However some
subjects which it embraces may have undergone more complete
investigation on the general view of the whole period this history
is the sole undisputed authority to which all defer and from which
few appeal to the original writers or to more modern compilers The
inherent interest of the subject the inexhaustible labor employed upon
it the immense condensation of matter the luminous arrangement the
general accuracy the style which however monotonous from its
uniform stateliness and sometimes wearisome from its elaborate ar
is throughout vigorous animated often picturesque always commands
attention always conveys its meaning with emphatic energy describes
with singular breadth and fidelity and generalizes with unrivalled
felicity of expression all these high qualifications have secured and
seem likely to secure its permanent place in historic literature

This vast design of Gibbon the magnificent whole into which he has cast
the decay and ruin of the ancient civilization the formation and birth
of the new order of things will of itself independent of the laborious
execution of his immense plan render The Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire an unapproachable subject to the future historian  in the
eloquent language of his recent French editor M Guizot

Footnote  A considerable portion of this preface has already appeared
before us public in the Quarterly Review

The gradual decline of the most extraordinary dominion which has
ever invaded and oppressed the world the fall of that immense empire
erected on the ruins of so many kingdoms republics and states both
barbarous and civilized and forming in its turn by its dismemberment
a multitude of states republics and kingdoms the annihilation of the
religion of Greece and Rome the birth and the progress of the two new
religions which have shared the most beautiful regions of the earth the
decrepitude of the ancient world the spectacle of its expiring glory
and degenerate manners the infancy of the modern world the picture of
its first progress of the new direction given to the mind and character
of mansuch a subject must necessarily fix the attention and excite
the interest of men who cannot behold with indifference those memorable
epochs during which in the fine language of Corneille

     Un grand destin commence un grand destin sacheve

This extent and harmony of design is unquestionably that which
distinguishes the work of Gibbon from all other great historical
compositions He has first bridged the abyss between ancient and modern
times and connected together the two great worlds of history The great
advantage which the classical historians possess over those of modern
times is in unity of plan of course greatly facilitated by the narrower
sphere to which their researches were confined Except Herodotus the
great historians of Greecewe exclude the more modern compilers like
Diodorus Siculuslimited themselves to a single period or at east to
the contracted sphere of Grecian affairs As far as the Barbarians
trespassed within the Grecian boundary or were necessarily mingled up
with Grecian politics they were admitted into the pale of Grecian
history but to Thucydides and to Xenophon excepting in the Persian
inroad of the latter Greece was the world Natural unity confined their
narrative almost to chronological order the episodes were of rare
occurrence and extremely brief To the Roman historians the course was
equally clear and defined Rome was their centre of unity and the
uniformity with which the circle of the Roman dominion spread around
the regularity with which their civil polity expanded forced as it
were upon the Roman historian that plan which Polybius announces as the
subject of his history the means and the manner by which the whole
world became subject to the Roman sway How different the complicated
politics of the European kingdoms Every national history to be
complete must in a certain sense be the history of Europe there is
no knowing to how remote a quarter it may be necessary to trace our most
domestic events from a country how apparently disconnected may
originate the impulse which gives its direction to the whole course of
affairs

In imitation of his classical models Gibbon places Rome as the cardinal
point from which his inquiries diverge and to which they bear constant
reference yet how immeasurable the space over which those inquiries
range how complicated how confused how apparently inextricable the
canuses which tend to the decline of the Roman empire how countless
the nations which swarm forth in mingling and indistinct hordes
constantly changing the geographical limitsincessantly confounding the
natural boundaries At first sight the whole period the whole state
of the world seems to offer no more secure footing to an historical
adventurer than the chaos of Miltonto be in a state of irreclaimable
disorder best described in the language of the poet

     A dark
     Illimitable ocean without bound
     Without dimension where length breadth and height

     And time and place are lost where eldest Night
     And Chaos ancestors of Nature hold
     Eternal anarchy amidst the noise
     Of endless wars and by confusion stand

We feel that the unity and harmony of narrative which shall comprehend
this period of social disorganization must be ascribed entirely to the
skill and luminous disposition of the historian It is in this sublime
Gothic architecture of his work in which the boundless range the
infinite variety the at first sight incongruous gorgeousness of
the separate parts nevertheless are all subordinate to one main and
predominant idea that Gibbon is unrivalled We cannot but admire the
manner in which he masses his materials and arranges his facts in
successive groups not according to chronological order but to their
moral or political connection the distinctness with which he marks his
periods of gradually increasing decay and the skill with which though
advancing on separate parallels of history he shows the common tendency
of the slower or more rapid religious or civil innovations However
these principles of composition may demand more than ordinary attention
on the part of the reader they can alone impress upon the memory the
real course and the relative importance of the events Whoever would
justly appreciate the superiority of Gibbons lucid arrangement should
attempt to make his way through the regular but wearisome annals of
Tillemont or even the less ponderous volumes of Le Beau Both these
writers adhere almost entirely to chronological order the consequence
is that we are twenty times called upon to break off and resume the
thread of six or eight wars in different parts of the empire to suspend
the operations of a military expedition for a court intrigue to hurry
away from a siege to a council and the same page places us in the
middle of a campaign against the barbarians and in the depths of the
Monophysite controversy In Gibbon it is not always easy to bear in mind
the exact dates but the course of events is ever clear and distinct
like a skilful general though his troops advance from the most
remote and opposite quarters they are constantly bearing down and
concentrating themselves on one pointthat which is still occupied
by the name and by the waning power of Rome Whether he traces the
progress of hostile religions or leads from the shores of the
Baltic or the verge of the Chinese empire the successive hosts of
barbariansthough one wave has hardly burst and discharged itself
before another swells up and approachesall is made to flow in the same
direction and the impression which each makes upon the tottering fabric
of the Roman greatness connects their distant movements and measures
the relative importance assigned to them in the panoramic history The
more peaceful and didactic episodes on the development of the Roman law
or even on the details of ecclesiastical history interpose themselves
as restingplaces or divisions between the periods of barbaric invasion
In short though distracted first by the two capitals and afterwards
by the formal partition of the empire the extraordinary felicity of
arrangement maintains an order and a regular progression As our horizon
expands to reveal to us the gathering tempests which are forming
far beyond the boundaries of the civilized worldas we follow their
successive approach to the trembling frontierthe compressed and
receding line is still distinctly visible though gradually dismembered
and the broken fragments assuming the form of regular states and
kingdoms the real relation of those kingdoms to the empire is
maintained and defined and even when the Roman dominion has shrunk
into little more than the province of Thracewhen the name of Rome
confined in Italy to the walls of the cityyet it is still the
memory the shade of the Roman greatness which extends over the wide
sphere into which the historian expands his later narrative the
whole blends into the unity and is manifestly essential to the double
catastrophe of his tragic drama

But the amplitude the magnificence or the harmony of design are
though imposing yet unworthy claims on our admiration unless the
details are filled up with correctness and accuracy No writer has been
more severely tried on this point than Gibbon He has undergone the
triple scrutiny of theological zeal quickened by just resentment of
literary emulation and of that mean and invidious vanity which delights
in detecting errors in writers of established fame On the result of
the trial we may be permitted to summon competent witnesses before we
deliver our own judgment

M Guizot in his preface after stating that in France and Germany as
well as in England in the most enlightened countries of Europe Gibbon
is constantly cited as an authority thus proceeds

I have had occasion during my labors to consult the writings of
philosophers who have treated on the finances of the Roman empire of
scholars who have investigated the chronology of theologians who have
searched the depths of ecclesiastical history of writers on law who
have studied with care the Roman jurisprudence of Orientalists who
have occupied themselves with the Arabians and the Koran of modern
historians who have entered upon extensive researches touching the
crusades and their influence each of these writers has remarked and
pointed out in the History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire some negligences some false or imperfect views some omissions
which it is impossible not to suppose voluntary they have rectified
some facts combated with advantage some assertions but in general
they have taken the researches and the ideas of Gibbon as points of
departure or as proofs of the researches or of the new opinions which
they have advanced

M Guizot goes on to state his own impressions on reading Gibbons
history and no authority will have greater weight with those to whom
the extent and accuracy of his historical researches are known

After a first rapid perusal which allowed me to feel nothing but
the interest of a narrative always animated and notwithstanding its
extent and the variety of objects which it makes to pass before the
view always perspicuous I entered upon a minute examination of the
details of which it was composed and the opinion which I then formed
